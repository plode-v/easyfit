This project was part of my personal project for React full-stack position.
EasyFit was inspired by popular mobile application **[MyFitnessPal][3]** where users can input their food calories and track their fitness goals throughout the fitness journey. EasyFit is simply the simpler version of MyFitnessPal that include similar functions such as:
**calories tracker**
**calories caculator**,
**update or delete the foods**
